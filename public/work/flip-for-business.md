In October, I developed a custom WordPress plugin through my workplace to support Flip for Business in its expansion efforts using WooCommerce. This plugin was specifically designed to streamline payment processes, ensuring seamless integration with WooCommerce's core features. By enhancing transaction management and operational efficiency, the plugin played a crucial role in optimizing the payment system to meet the growing needs of the business.
